# A-regression-approach-for-photodiode-Lux-Measurement-
Lux is measured using regression method
Photodiode is a semiconductor device that converts light into current when photon are absorbed on phodiode then it produces output current,  Photodiode has many features and application, Li-Fi is the new emerging technology where we can use the photodode for communication because it has high reception bandwith and high response as compared to Light dependent register(LDR) and phototransistor. Our smart phone consists of CMOS sensor which has a array of photodiode on single chip, that can be used for communication using rolling shutter effect.           Measuremt of lux is also very important for many application i.e. Received signal strength (RSS) calculation, Texus OPT101 photodiode is
